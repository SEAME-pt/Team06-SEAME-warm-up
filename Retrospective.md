# SEA:ME Warm-up module
## Team06 - Retrospective
These last two weeks our team worked on the SEA:ME warm-up module. This document serves to document our learning curve, all things we learned, challenges, setbacks and conclusions we reached, in order to hopefully start with the right foot the next sprint, the first from the course.

### Learning to know our teammates
Our group is very happy with oneanother - we have different strengths, different weaknesses, but always willing to discuss, help and learn from oneanother. This is fortunately something positive we have learned from the very beginning and will surely help in the future.

### Organization of the project repo
This was our first major setback. We did not know how or where we should save our code, and it was something we felt me took a while to figure it out. It was something that was punctual though, and after inquiring and learning from our colleagues and facilitators about the different possibilities, we found an architecture which suited us and we felt comfortable about. With that under our belt, we feel it will be easier to make that decision in the next sprint.

### Github organization
Another pretty big, and still in progress, learning curve was caused by our unfamiliarity with all the tools that Github has to offer. This is one of the topics that, although there was a big development over the last couple of weeks, is not comfortable just yet and we still think that can be improved. We think though that it will be something that will come with time.
So far, however, not only we have learned to use several Github tools available to us, such as the backlog, pull requests, tasks, actions, to name a few, but also how they can be connected to one another. We expect to solidify that knowledge and automatize the workflow during the course of the next few weeks.

### Piracer assembly
The assembly of the PiRacer was as smooth as it could have been. However, we are aware of some hardware compatibility issues that might arise (like installation of a RaspberryPi on a JetRacer, which supports Nvidia), and it will eventually have to be looked into.

### Modules
All modules were solved in a smooth manner by different members of the team. We decided to use eachother's strengths to distribute our work, and learn from eachother's code. A very big priority for the next comming days will be to fully share that knowledge among ourselves so we can start the next sprint as much on the same page as possible.

### Conclusion
Despite a couple of setbacks, we are fairly content with the way that this warm-up has gone, especially having into account our previous limited experience with working in a group and using the tools for that kind of work. The biggest priority for the next couple of days and as the next sprint (aka the beginning of the actual project) starts is to solidify what we have learned during these last couple of weeks and be sure we fully incorporate all the tools in our workflow.
