# JOURNAL (jmoreira)
## Module01
- Remembering basic C++ class and OOP concepts
- Improving on testing
### GitHub
- Workflow has improved a lot
### Thoughts
- Didn't spend the time to research further and implement Gherkin/Cucumber because it made more sense to work on other stuff, since it is more of a team working tool and as a team we aren't that confortable with testing methodologies yet. Will pick it up in the future
### Todo
- Complete the other warm-up modules
- Dive into Qt
- Keep improving tests and find other ways of testing, and test different stuff as well like format and tidy
- Not sure how it will be going foward, but tests specific to a section of code should only run if it was changed...
- Research Gherkin/Cucumber further
- Research MISRA
### Difficulties
- Still a lot to improving testing wise
- Found my C++ to be rusty, syntax mostly, but it is coming back
- Didn't get to learn/do everything I wanted in these 2 weeks, and I wish I didn't have to rush so much
- Not having defined timelines for each task resulted in spending too much time on stuff that wasn't essential
