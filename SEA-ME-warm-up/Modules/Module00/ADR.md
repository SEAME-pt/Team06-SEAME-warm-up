# ADR
## Module00
- Learning about qt and installing it
- Research about mono repos and git submodules
- Learning git pull request and git branch rules
- Setting up github projects and team
### ex02
- Github action with GTest
- Using CMake for the first time
- Remembering basic C++ like syntax and use of references, lvalues, rvalues
### ex03
- Remembering C++ classes
- Github action for compile check
## Thoughts
- Realizing one advantage of submodules: since filesystem changed in main branch, I will have to take extra steps to ensure the GitHub Action I setup will function
